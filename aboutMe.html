        <div class="imageBox">
          <p>I was born and raised on the South Coast of Massachusetts. From an early age I loved fishing and hiking. I would often draw the fish I caught in order to identify them. But there was one fateful fishing excursion that would change my life. There was a small greenish bird with a chestnut neck and breast on the shore catching more fish than I was. It followed me around catching the small fish spooked by my presence. I had to know what it was so I went home and looked it up in my old tattered wildlife encyclopedia. Turns out it was a Green-backed Heron (now called simply a Green Heron).Thus began my obsession with birds. As with the fish, sketching and drawing birds helped me identify them in the field. This healthy curiosity and creativity would culminate in a life long pursuit of being a wildlife artist.</p>
